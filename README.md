# IntechStudioGridDesigns (work-in-progress)
free and open source FreeCAD holder designs for Intech Studio Grid MIDI controllers. req. freecad 1.2.x+ (dev, or stable whenever that eventually happens)
I don't yet have the GRID3s, but since I anticipate buying them soon, I made this repository to at-least share them. if there are any issues, please let me know. I followed the GRID specification (dimension-wise) as much as possible, and I hope this is good


no documentation yet, but they're there!
